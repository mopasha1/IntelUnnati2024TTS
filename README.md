<summary>Running the application</summary>
To test out the entire project after installation, run the following:
 
```
cd streamlit
```
In the MainDashboard and Parking Data Insights generation file, replace the key with your Google Gemini API Key.

Running the Streamlit app
```
python -m streamlit run MainDashboard.py
```
To test out the CLI mode for the model inference, run the following code

```
cd src
python model_inference.py [arguments_list]

usage: model_inference.py [-h] (-i IMAGE | -v VIDEO) [-show SHOW] [--output OUTPUT]
```

CLI for the parking space detection can also be found in the same directory: 
```
python parking_inference.py [arguments_list]

usage: parking_inference.py [-h] (-i IMAGE | -v VIDEO) [-show SHOW] [--output OUTPUT]
```

Code for insights generation is present in the "streamlit" folder

### Details

The project contains the following:
1. **data** - Links to the datasets used for training, validation and testing purposes
2. **models** - The trained models for parking space detection, license plate detection, and license plates OCR. Also contains the model formats optimized for Edge AI inference, in ONNX, OpenVINO and NCNN formats
3. **notebooks** - Contains the notebooks used for model training and export.
4. **scripts** - Various miscellaneous scripts for preprocessing, data generation, test data sampling for export, etc.
5. **src** - The CLI based code for model inference of the parking space and license plate models.
6. **streamlit** - The code for running the model inference, parking space detection and insights generation modules. Part of the main source code of the project. 
7. **test_data** - Test images and videos for testing the license plate and parking detection models
8. **requirements.txt** - The requirements file, containing all dependencies for the project.
