The trained models used in the project, split into folder for OCR, license plate detection and parking spaces detection:
1. OpenVino: Use this model for fast CPU inference
2. TFLite: Use this model for fast inference on mobile devices
3. NCNN: Use this model for fast inference on ARM based Edge devices (eg. Raspberry Pi)
